## Project Overview

### Dataset
We used [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedbakhet/amazon-books-reviews/data) from 2022 which contains ~3 million user reviews and ~210 thousand books. For our analysis, we modified this dataset to suit our specific needs better.

Here is what our modified dataset looks like

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive data analysis on a dataset of Amazon book reviews. This analysis aims to uncover insights into the relationships between various factors such as genre, author, and user engagement with the reviews, ratings, and reception of books on Amazon. All analyses and visualizations are conducted using R.

### Key Research Question
What is the relationship between factors such as genre, author, and user engagement with the reviews, ratings, and reception of books on Amazon?
